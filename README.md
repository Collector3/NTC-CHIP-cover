# NTC-CHIP-cover
A cover for the NTC CHIP. Fits above NTC Co's injection molded bottom plate. 

The pictures show the 'dust cover' version with minimal slots for cooling. I've used this
for a CHIP designated as a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) collector/Grafana host and it's been working fine so far. Another model with
larger openings is available as [ntc_chip_lemon_slot.stl](https://github.com/Collector3/NTC-CHIP-cover/raw/master/ntc_chip_lemon_slot.stl).
